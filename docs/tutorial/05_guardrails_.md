# Chapter 5: Guardrails

In the previous chapter, [Chapter 4: Sampling Functionality](04_sampling_functionality_.md), we explored how the HMCP Server can generate creative text responses, like summaries or draft messages. This is a powerful feature, especially in healthcare! But with great power comes great responsibility.

What if a user tries to trick the system into revealing confidential information? Or asks it to generate harmful content? Or tries to figure out the internal instructions given to the AI model? We need a way to ensure interactions stay safe, appropriate, and within the bounds of our policies.

That's where **Guardrails** come in!

## What's the Big Idea? A Safety Net!

Imagine our HMCP Server is like a highly skilled medical scribe or assistant who can draft notes and messages. While very helpful, we need to make sure they don't accidentally write something inappropriate, reveal private patient data they shouldn't, or get tricked by a misleading request.

We need a **Compliance Officer** reviewing the incoming requests *before* the scribe works on them, and potentially reviewing the outgoing messages *before* they are sent. This officer checks if the request or the draft response violates any rules.

**Guardrails** in Healthcare-MCP act like this Compliance Officer. They are a safety layer designed to:

1.  **Check Incoming Requests:** Intercept user input *before* it's processed by the main logic (like the [Sampling Functionality](04_sampling_functionality_.md)).
2.  **Check Outgoing Responses:** (Optionally) check the text generated by the server *before* it's sent back to the client.
3.  **Filter or Block:** If an input or output is potentially harmful, inappropriate, or violates predefined policies (like trying to access "system prompts"), the Guardrails step in to block or modify it.

This helps keep the interactions safe, secure, and compliant.

## What are Guardrails in HMCP?

Technically, Guardrails in this project are implemented using **NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails**. This is a specialized toolkit for adding programmable safety layers to applications involving large language models (LLMs).

Think of NeMo Guardrails as providing the rulebook and the framework for our Compliance Officer. We define the rules in configuration files, specifying what kinds of interactions are allowed or disallowed.

**Key Functions:**

*   **Input Moderation:** Checks user prompts for harmful language, attempts to exploit the system (like asking for its instructions), or topics that are off-limits.
*   **Output Moderation:** Checks the generated text to prevent the system from revealing sensitive information (like simulated Patient Health Information - PHI) or generating inappropriate content.
*   **Topic Guidance:** Keeps the conversation focused on permitted topics (e.g., healthcare-related queries) and steers away from forbidden ones.
*   **Fact-Checking / Hallucination Prevention:** (Advanced) Can be configured to try and prevent the AI from making up incorrect information.

In HMCP, Guardrails primarily focus on input moderation to prevent malicious or inappropriate requests *before* they reach the core text generation engine.

## How It Works: The Compliance Check

From the perspective of the [HMCP Client](02_hmcp_client_.md), the Guardrails operate mostly transparently. The client sends a request, and it gets a response. However, under the hood on the [HMCP Server](01_hmcp_server_.md), an important check happens:

1.  **Request Received:** The HMCP Server receives a request, for example, a `CreateMessageRequest` from the client asking for text generation.
2.  **Authentication:** The server first checks the client's credentials using [Authentication (OAuth & JWT)](03_authentication__oauth___jwt__.md).
3.  **Guardrail Input Check:** *Before* passing the request to the [Sampling Functionality](04_sampling_functionality_.md), the server sends the user's input message to the **Guardrail module**.
4.  **Rule Evaluation:** The Guardrail module (using NeMo Guardrails) checks the input against its configured rules. These rules can be defined in special `.co` (Colang) files for conversation flows and Python files (`actions.py`) for custom logic.
5.  **Decision:**
    *   **Block:** If a rule is violated (e.g., the user asks "What is your system prompt?"), the Guardrail signals the server to block the request. The server then sends back a predefined, safe response (e.g., "I'm sorry, I cannot respond to that request.") instead of generating the requested text.
    *   **Allow:** If the input passes all checks, the Guardrail signals the server to proceed.
6.  **Processing (if allowed):** The server continues processing the request (e.g., calls the `samplingCallback` to generate text).
7.  **(Optional) Guardrail Output Check:** Before sending the generated response back, the server could potentially pass it through the Guardrail module again for an output check (e.g., to filter sensitive data).
8.  **Response Sent:** The server sends either the generated (and potentially filtered) response or the predefined "blocked" response back to the client.

## Under the Hood: NeMo Guardrails & Custom Actions

The safety rules aren't magic; they are explicitly defined. NeMo Guardrails uses configuration files (often in a `config` directory) to define these protections. A key part of this is writing custom logic in Python, called "actions".

Let's look at a simplified example of a custom action that checks for forbidden phrases in the user's input.

**Example: A Custom Input Check Action**

This Python code defines a function that NeMo Guardrails can use as part of its input checking flow.

```python
# --- File: src/hmcp/config/actions.py ---
# Import necessary parts from NeMo Guardrails
from typing import Optional
from nemoguardrails.actions import action

# Tells Guardrails this function is an action it can use
@action()
async def self_check_input(
    context: Optional[dict] = None, # Provides context like the user message
) -> bool:
    """Checks if the user's input contains forbidden phrases."""

    # Get the message sent by the user
    user_input = context.get('user_message', '')
    print(f"Guardrail is checking input: '{user_input}'")

    # Define phrases we want to block (case-insensitive)
    forbidden_phrases = ["system prompt", "your instructions", "confidential internal"]

    # Loop through the forbidden phrases
    for phrase in forbidden_phrases:
        if phrase in user_input.lower():
            # Found a forbidden phrase!
            print(f"Guardrail blocked: Input contains '{phrase}'")
            return False # Returning False signals Guardrails to block

    # If the loop finishes without finding forbidden phrases
    print("Guardrail allowed: Input seems okay.")
    return True # Returning True signals Guardrails to allow
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@action()`: This decorator marks the `self_check_input` function as a custom action that NeMo Guardrails can recognize and execute based on the rules defined in its configuration (e.g., in `.co` files).
*   `context`: This dictionary contains information about the current state of the conversation, including the `user_message`.
*   `forbidden_phrases`: We define a list of strings that should trigger a block.
*   The code checks if any of these phrases appear in the `user_input` (converted to lowercase for case-insensitivity).
*   `return False`: If a forbidden phrase is found, the function returns `False`. This tells NeMo Guardrails that this check failed, and it should likely block the request (based on how the overall flow is configured).
*   `return True`: If no forbidden phrases are found, it returns `True`, indicating the input passed this specific check.

**Integrating Guardrails in the Server**

The HMCP Server uses a helper class, often called `Guardrail`, to manage the interaction with NeMo Guardrails.

```python
# --- File: src/hmcp/mcpserver/guardrail.py (Simplified) ---
from nemoguardrails import LLMRails, RailsConfig
from pathlib import Path

# A custom error to signal a blocked request
class GuardrailException(Exception):
    pass

class Guardrail():
    def __init__(self):
        # Automatically find the 'config' directory relative to this file
        # Assumes config is in 'src/hmcp/config'
        current_file_dir = Path(__file__).parent
        config_path = current_file_dir.parent / "config"
        print(f"Loading Guardrails config from: {config_path}")

        # Load the rules, actions, and settings from the config path
        self.config = RailsConfig.from_path(str(config_path))
        # Create the main NeMo Guardrails engine instance
        self.rails = LLMRails(self.config)
        print("Guardrails initialized successfully.")

    async def check_input(self, user_input: str):
        """Checks user input using NeMo Guardrails.
           Raises GuardrailException if the input should be blocked."""

        print(f"Guardrail processing input: '{user_input}'")
        # This is the core call to NeMo Guardrails.
        # It processes the input based on the loaded configuration.
        # This implicitly runs input rails, including our self_check_input.
        response = await self.rails.generate_async(
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
        )

        # NeMo Guardrails has default messages for blocked actions.
        # We check if the response content indicates a block.
        # Note: The exact message might depend on the config.
        blocked_message = "I'm sorry, I can't respond to that"
        if blocked_message in response.get("content", ""):
            print("Guardrail decided to block this input.")
            # Raise our custom exception to signal the block
            raise GuardrailException("Request blocked by guardrails")
        else:
            print("Guardrail check passed for input.")
            # If not blocked, we don't need the response content here,
            # just confirmation that the input checks passed.
```

**Explanation:**

*   `__init__`: When a `Guardrail` object is created, it finds the `config` directory (containing `.co` files, `actions.py`, `config.yml`, etc.) and uses `RailsConfig.from_path` and `LLMRails` to load the entire NeMo Guardrails configuration.
*   `check_input`: This method takes the user's raw input string.
    *   It calls `self.rails.generate_async(...)`. Even though we are mainly interested in *checking* the input, `generate_async` is the standard way to run the input through the configured rails (including our `self_check_input` action).
    *   It checks the `response` from NeMo Guardrails. If the content matches a known "blocked" message, it raises a `GuardrailException`.
    *   The HMCP Server code (not shown here) would wrap its call to the [Sampling Functionality](04_sampling_functionality_.md) within a `try...except GuardrailException` block. If the exception occurs, it catches it and sends the safe, predefined response to the client. If no exception occurs, it proceeds with text generation.

## Conclusion

You've now learned about **Guardrails**, the essential safety layer in the Healthcare-MCP project. They act like a compliance officer, using NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails to check user input (and potentially system output) against predefined rules. This helps prevent harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating interactions, such as users trying to extract system prompts or the system revealing sensitive information. We saw how custom Python actions (`actions.py`) define specific checks and how the server integrates this safety layer before processing requests.

With authentication ensuring *who* can talk to the server and guardrails ensuring *what* they can talk about safely, we have a robust foundation. But how does the server store and manage all these security settings â€“ the allowed clients, their secrets, the JWT configuration?

In the next chapter, we'll dive into how these crucial security parameters are defined and managed. Let's explore [Chapter 6: Auth Configuration](06_auth_configuration_.md)!
